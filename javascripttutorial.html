        // Creating variables
        // At this point the value of the below variable would be undefined
        var myvariable;

        // You can define it by any of the following below
        var myvariable = 5;
        // or
        myvariable = 5;

        
        // Operators
        // Concatenation
        var words = "This is";
        var morewords = " a sentence";
        var sentence = words + morewords;
        document.write(sentence);

        // Addition
        var num1 = 5;
        var num2 = 3;
        var total = num1 + num2;
        document.write(total);

        var total = num1++;
        // ++ increments the variable. So this is the same as adding one to it
        // you can also do
        num1--;
        ++num1;
        --num1;
        // depending on when you want the operation to be evaluated

        // Strings are stored as objects. They have their own internal properties. For example, the length of the string... We can access that by the following
        var alpha = "ABCDEFG";
        var length = alpha.length;
        document.write(length); // Output will 7 because this string has 7 characters

        // String also have methods you can call. Methods are different than properties
        // One example string method is called substring, which will export a portion of a string
        var alpha = "ABCDEFG";
        var result = alpha.substring(3, 6); // going up to sixth index but not including index. 
        document.write(result); // Output will be DEF
